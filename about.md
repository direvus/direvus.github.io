# About the author

Hi, I'm Brendan.

I'm a software developer by day, but by night ...

Well, okay, yes, I'm a software developer by night too.  But in my spare time I
also like to do woodworking with hand tools.

# About the project

After several years of trying to make do with a rickety old bench, in December
2018 I finally worked up the gumption to go ahead and build a proper workbench
of my own.

This build follows the plans from Paul Sellers' [Woodworking Masterclasses](https://woodworkingmasterclasses.com/videos/workbench-introduction/) (free sign-in required).
This is a relatively simple bench design in structural pine, so it's a good
choice for my first attempt.  Well, that's the theory anyhow.
