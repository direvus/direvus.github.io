title:  The remaining clamps arrive

My back-ordered clamps from Timbecon arrived, so I now have a full set of four
very substantial 1200mm T-bar clamps.

I'm planning to borrow a few pipe clamps from my dad, which should give me
enough clamps in total to be getting on with the benchtop lamination.

In the meantime, I've planed up a few more of the benchtop pieces, but we've
had a very signficant heat wave in Canberra, and my interest in spending time
in my un-air-conditioned shed has been severely impacted.  Progress has been
slow.
