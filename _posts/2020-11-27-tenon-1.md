title:  The first tenon

Over the last three weeks I've been slowly working away at fitting my first
tenon.

First I needed to get all of my rail pieces cut to length and squared up.
There was a bit of twist in the rails but it wasn't too bad.

Next was laying out the tenons.  I allowed enough length on the tenons to
travel all the way through the mortise, plus another 12mm in addition to that.
This allows for the lower rail to protrude slightly.

I cut all four rails to the same length initially, even though the top rails
will end up being shorter, so that I could lay out all four tenons together,
ensuring that the inner distance between the legs will be consistent across the
rails.

Then I got to work on cutting the first tenon on my left top rail.  That's when
I discovered that my tenon saw was not big enough to cut down a 102mm tenon
cheek!  So after going down as deeply as I could with the tenon saw, I finished
the cut with my normal hand saw.  That's not optimal, especially when trying to
keep the cutting edge of the saw perfectly level so that I don't cut into the
shoulder, but I did get there in the end.

## Lessons learned

I was a little too conservative on leaving the tenon fat with my initial saw
cuts, which meant I had a lot of extra work to do in trimming it down to fit
the mortise.  Next time I think I'll go a little closer to the line.

## What's next

Cutting and fitting the tenon at the other end of the left top rail.
