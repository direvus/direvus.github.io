I removed the clamps from the lamination and had a look at the results.

While the whole piece is nice and solid, and there are no failed joins, some of
the joins aren't as tight as I would have liked.  In part I suspect this is due
to having the four heavier T-bar clamps all on the top side of the piece, and
the three lighter pipe clamps on the underside.  So I think that there was
greater total clamping pressure across the top side, which allowed the pieces
to "fan out" towards the bottom.

I made a start on planing down the top face of the benchtop.  The idea here is
to make sure that the face is flat across its width, all the way along.  On
this face, it was consistently high at the edges and low in the middle, which I
think is at least in part due to the "fan out" effect I mentioned.

## Lessons learned

- Try to balance out the clamping pressure at the top and bottom of the piece.
