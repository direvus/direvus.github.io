title:  Applying the finish, and dismantling the old bench
date:   2021-01-05

I applied my first coat of finish to the new bench.  I think it's coming up really nicely.  The finish I'm using is Monocel outdoor furniture oil.  It's supposed to be a minimum of 2 coats, with 24 hours between each coat.

In the meanwhile, I decided to tidy up the shed and dismantle the old
workbench.

On further consideration, it seems a bit inappropriate to call this thing a
"workbench".  It's so rickety it barely even qualifies as a "table".
"Sculpture", maybe?

{% include figure.html source="old-bench-disassembly.jpg" alt="old bench disassembly" caption="This provocative work invites the viewer to consider the question: can a whole bunch of mismatched screws substitute for proper joinery?  The work then boldly posits its own answer to that question, which is a resounding &ldquo;Nope&rdquo;." %}

I am very excited to never have to look at, or touch, this awful pile of junk
again.

## What's next

- Applying the second and final coat of oil.
- Moving the new bench into position.
