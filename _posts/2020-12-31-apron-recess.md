title:  Cutting the apron leg recesses

I went back to the apron pieces that I laminated about a year ago, and spent
some time working on them with the plane to get them flat(ish) and squared up
for layout.

Then I cut out some wedges from 18mm stock.

My original plan had the wedges go from 45mm at the top to 30mm at the bottom,
but I think that was based on starting from 18x45mm stock.  I actually ended up
with 18x90 stock, so I adjusted the wedges to go from 40mm to 25mm instead.
This meant I was easily able to get two wedges side-by-side out of the stock,
and also meant I have less work to do in cutting out the recesses.

Then I laid out the recesses, starting with the rear apron piece (in case I
make mistakes), and got to chopping and routing them out.

I made a start on the second recess, I've got the walls chopped down almost to
depth, and will go in with the router after I split out the internal waste with
a chisel.

## What's next

Continuing to chop out the apron recesses until all four are done.
