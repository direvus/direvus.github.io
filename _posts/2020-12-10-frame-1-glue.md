title:  Gluing up the frame

There was nothing left to do on the first frame but to get on with the glue up.

I took the frame apart, gave one of the joints a tiny bit of extra finessing,
then I set the front leg in the workmate.

The idea here was to glue the front leg joints first, so that if I caused any
damage to the end of the tenon while striking with the mallet, at least that
damage would be on the backside.

I spread glue on each cheek of the bottom rail tenon, inserted into the mortise
and then beat on the end with a mallet (using a spare piece of wood in between
the mallet and the tenon) until it was close to fully seated.

Then I did the same for the top rail.

Next I laid the partial frame over on each side, to spread glue on to the
remaining tenon cheeks, stood it back up in the workmate, and finally, put the
rear leg over the top of both tenons and malleted it into position.

Then I took the whole assembled frame over to my workbench top and set up the
clamps.

After the clamps were on, I gradually worked my way around, tightening up each
clamp until I was happy that all the tenons were firmly seated and the pressure
was distributed fairly evenly across the joints.

Now I just have to leave this for 24 hours, then come back and chisel out the
excess glue.
