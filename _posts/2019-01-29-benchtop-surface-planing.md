title:  Planing the benchtop surface

I continued to plane down the top face of the benchtop.  After a considerable
effort I am fairly satisfied with how flat the surface is, and my next task
will be to flip the piece over and start to work on the underside.

I was very pleased with how my plane performed during this part of the build.
At a very heavy set on the blade, the plane took shaving after shaving, with
barely a hesitation and very few instances of wood getting stuck under the
chipbreaker.
