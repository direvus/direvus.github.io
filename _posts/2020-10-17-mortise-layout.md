First time back at the workbench project in over a year and half!  Yikes.

After clearing some blockers, it's finally time to get back to building my
bench.

I had a bit of a refresher on where I was up to in the build process, finishing
planing down the second of my rail pieces, and then got to work on laying out
the mortises for the first leg.

My Veritas mortise marking gauge got a workout for the first time -- very nice!

In the background of the photo, you might be able to make out (one of) the
reasons I haven't been doing any woodwork for a really long time.  She's 2 1/4
and had a great time moving the bench dogs around in my workmate while I did my
stuff.

The next task is to actually cut those mortises.  Looking forward to that,
hopefully my next entry won't be another 18 months away.
