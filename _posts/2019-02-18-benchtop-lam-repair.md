title:  Repairing the failed lamination
date:   2019-02-18

Over the last few sessions I've been flattening and untwisting my first two
apron pieces, but I decided it was about time I did something about the
partially failed lamination in the benchtop.  I noticed that the gap between
the planks was accumulating dust and shavings, and figured that this would
probably force the gap to continue to widen.  It seemed like the longer I
ignored this problem, the harder it was going to be to recover from.

First I cleared out the gap of debris with a putty knife, then ran glue along
the edge of the gap, and forced the glue down into the gap with the putty
knife.  Once I thought I had enough glue in there, I stood the benchtop up on
edge and clamped it.

The gap seemed to close up fairly well, and I found it encouraging that glue
was visibly squeezed out all along the line when I tightened down on the
clamps.  Tomorrow I'll find out whether this has actually worked.

## Lessons learned

- Probably should have tried to fix this immediately, rather than leaving it
  for a couple of weeks.
