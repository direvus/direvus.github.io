title:  Planing the laminated aprons

Both aprons are now laminated, and the results aren't bad at all.  I think that
the pieces could have been a little more flat relative to each other, but the
joins do seem to be very solid.

Now it's a process of planing down the surfaces and making sure that the aprons
are flat and square, and then the next task is to start putting together the
leg frames.
