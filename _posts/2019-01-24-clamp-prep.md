title:  Preparing the clamps

Having successfully borrowed three pipe clamps from my dad, I spent some time
preparing the clamps for the lamination effort.  I cut out small pieces of
marine plywood, and used double-sided tape to stick them onto the jaws of the
clamps.  Not a difficult job, but with 14 jaws in total to do, it certainly
took a while.

I also completed planing the surfaces of all of the benchtop pieces, so the
next step is the actual lamination.
