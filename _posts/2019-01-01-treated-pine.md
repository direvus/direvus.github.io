title:  The treated pine blues

After I duly consulted the website and carefully made a shopping list of all
the timber I was going to need, Dad and I set off to Bunnings.  Only, upon
arriving at the store, we discovered that all of the structural pine they had
in stock was treated.  It turns out that the Bunnings website lists all of the
products that are available at any Bunnings across Australia, so it really does
pay to check whether a given store has the thing you need **before** driving
out there!

Nonetheless, I bought the pre-laminated panel I intend to use for the
wellboard, and some DAR pieces including posts for the legs, the frame bearers
and the apron wedges and wedge retainers.  While we were there I also picked up
some 45Ã—70 H2 treated pine in the hopes that the vivid blue colour from the
treatment would not penetrate throughout the timber, so wouldn't be an issue
once the outer surface was planed away.  Those hopes went entirely unrealised.
After planing back the surface, the blue crap did indeed permeate through the
whole material, following along the growth lines of the tree.

## Lessons learned

- Just because it's on the website doesn't mean the store has it.
- H2 treated pine is no good for fine woodwork.
