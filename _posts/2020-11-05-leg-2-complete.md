Today I finished my fourth mortise, which means I now have my first two legs
ready to go.

The fourth mortise was as good or even slightly better than the third, which is
pretty good going, considering it's a longer mortise and in a more difficult
position.

I'm really happy with this result.  The good alignment on the third mortise
could have been a fluke, but with two good ones in a row I'm more confident
that my current approach is genuinely helping.

## What's next

Cutting the rails to length, planing them flat & square and then cutting some
tenons.
