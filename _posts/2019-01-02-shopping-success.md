After a lot of phone calls to hardware shops around Canberra, many of which
were closed for the holidays, I finally found a business that would sell me
some untreated structural pine: Home Timber and Hardware on Yass Rd in
Queanbeyan.  They had two sizes that I could use in MGP10, 45×70 and 45×140.  I
worked out that the 140 size would work for my leg frame rails, and could also
make up the aprons if I laminate two boards together edge-on.

The young chap who served me at Home Timber was friendly, efficient and
helpful.  Five stars.

I also some fasteners I needed, picked up an offcut of decking hardwood that
would serve for my vice jaw liners, and stopped by Spotlight afterwards to pick
up some leather pieces to finish the liners.

All round, a completely successful afternoon of shopping -- finally I had all
the materials I needed to get started on the project.
