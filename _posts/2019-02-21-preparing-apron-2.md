title:  Preparing the second apron

Yesterday I unclamped the first apron lamination and had a look.  I think it
was a success.  Definitely a more consistently tight join than what I had on
the benchtop.

Unfortunately when I went to move the two other apron pieces that I had stashed
on the floor under my saw horses, I realised that I had left them in a position
where the excess glue from the lamination had dribbled on to the wood.  That
was dumb.

I also found that my T-bar clamps had some discolouration on the beam where it
was in contact with the glue.  I'm not sure whether this is rust or some other
deposit, but in any case I sanded the beams back a little bit to remove it.

So, after scraping those pieces clean and giving the laminated apron a few
passes with the plane to clear the join, today I set that aside and started
work on preparing the second apron.

Working on the first of the two pieces for this new apron, after doing a first
pass to flatten out the face, I discovered that there was a very substantial
twist in the wood.  Enough that, once I knew about it, I was able to see it
with the unaided eye.  There was probably about 3-4mm to be removed at each of
the high corners, which doesn't sound like a lot, but when you're planing it
down (while maintaining flatness across the width) it's tough going.

I did eventually get the twist out, then planed and squared off the edges, and
finally flattened and untwisted the other face.  It was hard work but very
satisfying.

## Lessons learned

- Pay attention to what's underneath when laminating.
- Think about putting some material between the work piece and the beam of the
  clamp to protect it.
