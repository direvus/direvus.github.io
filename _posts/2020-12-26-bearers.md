title:  Installing the leg frame bearers

I got my second leg frame out of the clamps after the glue had time to set, and chiselled out the excess glue.

I found that on the right-hand frame, at the front, the top rail tenon was
sitting flush with the outside of the frame.  So I took that down a bit with a
chisel.

Next up was installing the leg frame bearers.  This was a pretty simple
process, just a couple of 90 x 30 planks cut to length and screwed on to the
tops of the frames.

The bearers are cut just a millimeter or so short at both ends, so that if the
leg frames shrink with age, the bearers don't end up pushing the aprons away.
It's the same reason we cut the top rail tenons a little short of flush.

## What's next

Final preparation of the apron pieces that I laminated way back in the early
days of the project.  I need to get them flat, square and clean for layout of
the leg frame recesses.
