I cut and fit the wellboard piece between the benchtop and the rear apron.  The
original plan called for a tongue-and-groove joint on both sides of the
wellboard, but this seemed like a very difficult joint to do well over such a
length, even if I had a fully functional plough plane and rebate plane (which I
do not).  So in the end I decided not to do the groove at all, and just fit the
wellboard in.  If this turns out to allow too much flex in the bench overall, I
can always install battens against the rear apron and screw the wellboard to
those.

It wouldn't be a terrible idea to get some quadrant beading to run along the
top of the wellboard just to make it a bit easier to keep it clean.  I've
noticed that there is already a fair bit of debris accumulating inside the
small gap on either side of the wellboard.

Then I moved on to installing the vise.  The first step was to lay out and cut
a hole for the back of the vise to slide in to.  From watching Paul's video, it
seemed like getting enough of a cut to start sawing was a major hassle, so I
borrowed a jigsaw from my Dad for this part.  It's not important that the hole
be exact or pretty, so I wasn't bothered about whether it would be a bit crude.

The jigsaw was pretty useful, but slow going.  If I needed to make a similar
cut in future, I would probably use the jigsaw just to establish enough of a
cut for me to get my handsaw in, and use the handsaw the rest of the way as it
is much faster.

Then it was just a matter of mounting the vise through the hole, installing a
few screws and getting the bench back upright.

Now I just need to install the jaw liners in the vise to get it fully armed and
operational.  I had originally bought a piece of decking hardwood to be the
vise liner, but on further consideration I decided that the grooves cut into
the underside of the timber would look stupid and annoy me.  So I need to
source some plain 19 x 90mm hardwood for this task.

## Lessons learned

Make sure your hands are fully clear before you trigger the quick release on a
vise you've got sitting vertically.  I got rid of a good amount of skin off my
knuckle by failing to heed this lesson today.

## What's next

- Installing the vise liners.
- Making and installing the wedge retainers.
- Adding beading to the wellboard.
