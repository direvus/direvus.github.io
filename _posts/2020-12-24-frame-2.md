title:  Completing the second leg frame

I finished cutting and fitting the tenons on the bottom rail, then went
straight on to planing all the pieces of the second frame smooth, trimming the
top tenons and rounding over the bottom tenons, then gluing up the frame.

I'm really happy with the accuracy of the joinery here, it's a substantial and
clear improvement over the first leg frame.  These joints are really tight and
I feel like all my effort has completely paid off.

## What's next

Trimming out the dry glue from the leg frame, then attaching the bearers to
both frames.
