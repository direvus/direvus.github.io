I've got both of the tenons on the new top rail to the point where they roughly fit into the second frame.

I think there's still a little work to do on the last few mills at the base of
the rear tenon, it's not quite seating down as well as I'd like.  But otherwise
I'm very happy with how these two tenons are fitting.

## What's next

Cutting and fitting the bottom rail tenons.
