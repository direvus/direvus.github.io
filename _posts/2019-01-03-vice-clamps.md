My shipment of tools from Timbecon arrived, with my new vice, but with only two
of my four T-bar clamps.  I looked back at the invoice that had been emailled
out to me, and sure enough in the notes it said that only two of the clamps had
been shipped, and that the other two were on "back order".  That’s the kind of
thing it would be handy to send a dude a separate email about.

The vice and the clamps themselves are impressive, very solid, well oiled,
smooth action on everything.  The vice on its own feels like it weighs at least
20kg.

I made a start on planing up the lamination surfaces on the 45×70 pieces for
the benchtop.  I have nine pieces total, but I will only put eight of them in
to the benchtop.  The plan is to prepare all nine pieces, and then pick the
best eight for use in the bench, and keep the ninth as general stock.  I got as
far as planing four of the nine pieces today.

## Lessons learned

- When ordering from Timbecon, check the invoice!
