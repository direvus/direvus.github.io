title:  Trimming the benchtop end

Today I trimmed the end of the benchtop.  I cut a knife line about 10mm from 
the end, squared off from the front edge, down the top side and underside, and 
then cut along the line with a handsaw.

I did make a dumb mistake when drawing my knife line -- part of the edge did not 
lie square to the top face, and I didn't check this before marking the line.  
So now I have a knife cut running across the face of the benchtop that really 
shouldn't be there.

Even though this is soft pine, cutting through that volume of material took a
surprisingly large amount of time and significant effort.  I had intended to 
cut both ends of the benchtop today, but the other end will have to wait for 
another occasion.

After finishing the cut, I planed the end grain smooth using a small block 
plane.

## Lessons learned

- Check all surfaces for square before marking lines!
