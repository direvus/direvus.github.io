title:  Planing the benchtop underside
date:   2019-02-01

Today's effort was to plane down the underside face of the benchtop.  The plane
continued to perform admirably, and even thought the underside was considerably
more rugged than the topside, I was able to complete the surface in one
session.

The objective of planing down the underside is mainly to get a smooth flat
surface in the areas where the underside will register against the leg frame
bearers, and to make sure that those areas are not twisted relative to each
other.  Checking with my winding sticks, I'm fairly confident that there is no
significant twist.

The next task will be to trim up the end and cut the benchtop to length.
