After getting about halfway through the mortise, I flipped the leg over and
started cutting from the other side.

I was making really good progress with my cuts, and eventually broke through to
the other side.  And that's when I noticed that my holes were quite badly
misaligned.

It turned out that the cuts on both sides of my mortise had drifted off the
vertical by a few degrees.  It was enough to create a difference of about 5mm
where they joined in the centre.

So, that is not good.

I seriously considered just scrapping this leg piece and starting again with a
new one, but ultimately I decided to persevere and see if I could salvage this.

By putting a clamp up against the reference face, and using it as a visual
guide to see whether my chisel was travelling correctly, and making sure to
stand at the end of the work piece rather than side-on, I was able to get a
much better direction on my cuts.

I ended up cutting down through the original (intended) centre of the mortise,
clearing out part of the sloped sides from both ends to get a kind of
compromise.

In the right-hand image, it almost looks like a normal mortise.  But in the
left-hand image, you can see what a botch it is.

I really won't know just how successful the salvage effort was until I start
trying to fit a tenon into it.  If I can't get a tenon through, I may need to
pare back the walls of the mortise further.

Since the glue on the tenon won't have much to purchase on to inside of this
mortise, it might be worth adding a draw bore just to make sure the joint stays
nice and tight.
