title:  Laminating the first apron

Today I unclamped the re-laminated benchtop, and it looks pretty good!
Definitely a join where once there was a gap.  So that's a win.  I spent some
time planing down the benchtop to remove excess dried glue, and to reflatten
now that the gap has closed.

Then I got back to work on the apron pieces.  I got the joining edges to a
point where I thought they were fitting quite well.

I set up the clamps on my saw horses and ran the glue.  I think I used enough
this time!

I put the edges together and rubbed them lengthwise to get the glue spread
right across the joining surfaces, then evened up the ends and clamped.  There
was a good amount of glue coming from the join, so I think that's a positive
sign.

I deliberately set up my T-bar clamps with one on top and one below on the far
ends of the lamination, with the pipe clamps evenly spaced across the middle.
I continued tightening up the clamps over the next few minutes and then scraped
off the excess glue and left the assembly to set.

## Lessons learned

- None yet, but I suspect there will be some when I inspect the finished
  product of this next lamination.
