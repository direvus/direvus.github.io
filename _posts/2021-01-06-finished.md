I put the second and final coat of oil on the bench and moved it into position
in my shed.

{% include figure.html source="finished4.jpg" alt="finished bench" caption="The finished workbench" %}

And ... that's it.  I'm done.

From here there are a bunch of customisations and improvements I can make to
the bench, but none of it is essential.  I'll probably make a tool tray to go
on the rear side, for example.  I imagine that by using the bench I will
naturally figure out what conveniences I want to add.

For now, it's time to enjoy the result.

Thanks for reading.
