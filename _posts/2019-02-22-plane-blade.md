I stopped to take a picture of my plane blade just after sharpening it, for no
other reason than I think it looks cool, and I'm proud of how sharp I can now
get this thing in just a few minutes of effort.

I use the Paul Sellers technique for sharpening plane blades and chisels, you can watch his video about it here:
