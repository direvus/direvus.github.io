Over the last few days I've been cutting the mortises in the final leg and it's been going really well.

On the very last mortise, when I broke through to the other side, it lined up perfectly!

This was definitely the most accurate mortise of the lot, I'm really proud of
it.  To get a perfect alignment across 90mm of material is not at all easy.

And with a little bit of cleanup, that's all the mortises completed.

## What's next

Cutting and fitting the tenons.
