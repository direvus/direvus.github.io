title:  Starting the second leg frame

After taking the first leg frame out of its clamps and trimming the glue out, I made a start on the second leg frame.

First up was making sure that the two leg pieces were straight and square, and
I had a bit of work to do planing down to get them there.

Then I laid out the mortises on both legs.

I then cut the lower mortise.  This one went really well, I was completely satisfied with how accurate it was.  It also went a lot faster than my first few, so that practice is really paying dividends at the moment.

And it was much the same story with the upper mortise.  Overall, a great
success on both of these.

## What's next

Cutting the mortises on the next and final leg piece.
